# Tic-Tac-Toe-Arduino
Arduino project which represents a playable version of Tic Tac Toe on a Arduino Mega 256 board. The only component necessary besides the Arduino board is a 4X3 Keypad which is used as
input. The digit keys are used for writing X or 0 on the playable board, the "0" key ends the game, the asterisk key resets the game and the "#" resets the current round.
